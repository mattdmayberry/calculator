# Build a calculator app with React

Final project for [Meta's React Basics course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics). For this assessment, you are tasked with building a simple calculator in React. You are provided with code snippets, and your task is to use these, plus any of your code to complete a calculator app that can perform the four basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Running the Project

Change the current directory to the project folder and install the dependencies:
```bash
cd calculator
npm ci 
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start 
```
Now, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project.

## Usage

1. Use the on-screen buttons Add: "+", Subtract: "-", Multiply: "x", Divide: "/" to perform calculations on the previous result (or 0 for the first calculation).
2. Use the on-screen buttons "Reset Input" and "Reset Result" to clear the input and result fields, respectively.
